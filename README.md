# berke1337_re
Reverse engineering challenges for berke1337.

## How to run the programs 
- [Download and install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
- Run `docker build -t re https://github.com/nigel/berke1337_re.git`
- Run `docker run -it re` to interact with the programs!
- If you have `gcc` installed on your computer, you won't need docker. Just run `gcc chal1.c -fno-stack-protection -g` to compile your own programs.
